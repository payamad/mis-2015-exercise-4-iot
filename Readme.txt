According to sensor overview page in developer.google.com, when the device is not moving, for
instance when we are sitting,the average is about 9.81. In addition, by testing the software
and watching the results, We found out the average for walking is around 10 to 15. Finally,
we considered average values above 15 as a running situation.

By testing the software, we found out to achieve the best results, it is better to have a big
value for FFT window and a low sample rate or to select a low value for FFT window and a big
value for sample rate. However the first approach is much more precise.
